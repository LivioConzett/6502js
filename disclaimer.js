I am not an expert in any of the things on this site, be it webdevelopment or the 6502 processor, nor do I claim to be.<br>
While I do have a technical background, it is not primarily in computer science.
Everything I know about programming and computers I have taught myself through books, videos, and the internet in general.<br>
Practically all the information I have about the 6502 processor and the 6502 Assembly language I have taken in
good faith from the book:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/13886/6502-Software-Design/">
<i>6502 Software Design</i> by Lea J. Scanlon</a><br>
and the webseries:<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH">
<i>Build a 65c02-based computer from scratch</i> by Ben Eater</a>.<br>
This whole site was made as a way to learn more about the 6502 processor and computers in general.<br>
I am a single person that made this as a hobby. While I tested as much as I could, the lack of a proper QA department will let itself be shown.
If you happen across any mistakes, be it gramatical, factual, or functual, please do not hesitate to contact me at:

While I don't have a lot of time to put towards this project, I am happy over constructive feedback and will get back to you as soon as I can.
